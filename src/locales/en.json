            "content": "Guru Jambhoji was incarnated in Vikram Samvat 1508 and attained Mahaparinirvana on Mingsar Badi Navami in Vikram Samvat 1593. Throughout his life, Guru Jambhoji preached to people through his words and taught the right way to live. Randheer Ji Babal was a Patvi and Hazuri (close associate) disciple of Lord Jambheshwar and always stayed with him. Poet Sahabramji Rahad has written in his book Jambhsar that when Guru Jambhoji was about to become invisible, his disciples asked - 'Maharaj, what will happen to us? Who will be the master of the sect?' Then Guru Jambhoji gave different garbs to four saints and bestowed different seats (Gaddis)."

On this journey, he came into contact with Guru Maharaj Shri, listened to his sermons, and subsequently got initiated into the Bishnoi sect. Randheer Ji Babal founded the village of Padiyal (Phalodi) in V.S. 1542. Later on, he and his family started living in Padiyal. From there, he began visiting Samrathal to listen to the teachings of Guru Jambhoji. Gradually, retiring from his social responsibilities, he settled permanently in Samrathal with the Guru. Randheer Ji Babal always stayed with his Guru to spread religious principles, teach the Guru's words to common people, impart knowledge, perform Havan and Puja, awaken them, and personally express reverence to his Guru through Sakhi recitals and Aartis."

From today, you hold the authority over this place.\" The poet further says that the Jambh Peera made Mahant Randheera the master of the Mukam with his own hands. Randheer Ji Babal was a householder and had a family, but after coming under the shelter of Guru Jambhoji, he became a saint."
